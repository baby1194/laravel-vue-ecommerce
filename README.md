## Setup

-   Fork or clone the project

-   Ensure you have PHP 8.2.4 or newer installed and setup properly (alternatively use Docker, see <https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sail>)

-   Ensure you have access to a PostgreSQL database

-   Ensure you have Node installed

-   Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and modify the values

-   Run `composer install` to install the PHP dependencies with Composer. Check out <https://getcomposer.org/> if necessary

-   Run `npm install` to install the Node dependencies needed by the project. Check out <https://nodejs.org/en/> if necessary

-   Run `php artisan migrate:install` to setup the Laravel database migrations

-   You should create at least one sample product. Although you can use the builtin factory seeders, I prefer to do manual creation for testing purposes.

    To do so run these commands after running `php artisan tinker`:

    ```php
    $product = new App\Models\Product();
    $product->name = 'Example Product';
    $product->slug = 'example-product';
    $product->description = 'Example product description';
    $product->imageUrl = 'https://placehold.co/400x400';
    $product->price = 99;
    $product->save();
    ```

-   Run `npm run watch` to serve the Vue 3 files

-   Run `php artisan serve` to serve the PHP files

-   Open up `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## TODO

-   Do WCAG analysis and ensure there are no issues

-   Fix hardcoded currency

-   Finish implementing search with meilisearch-vue or vue-instantsearch when Vue 3 is supported

-   Add some tests to verify that the cart and checkout works correctly

-   Consider adding an admin dashboard

-   Look into performance optimization
